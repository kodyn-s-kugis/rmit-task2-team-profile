									<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Chris</strong> (s3851483). I’m very excited to be a part of (teamname). I was born and I’m based in Brisbane and spent most of my time growing up here apart from a brief stint in Melbourne for primary school. I started a Bachelor of Engineering in 2014 and dropped out fairly quickly as I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to pursue as a career. Since then I have been working mainly in call centres, such as Compare the Market and Australia Post, doing a combination of sales and customer service. I have limited experience in IT thus far, apart from simple skills acquired from my prior roles, and building and playing with computers throughout high school. Experimenting with computers, and various software has been a major motivator in opening up my interest into IT. My hobbies include binging Netflix, computer games and board games; Splendor is one of my favourites.</p>

									<p>I'm <strong>Raymond</strong> (s3853718).I was born and raised in Australia, with my family coming from a Chinese background. I have extended family who live in China and Hong Kong, that I occasionally visit and stay with during vacation periods.  I come primarily from a science background, working in labs doing genetic sequencing and testing. Work that I've done that you might encounter  is a maize product which I worked with, looking to improve yield in unfavourable conditions. While I enjoyed my brief time in this industry, for personal reasons I decided a career change would be for the best and am looking into the IT sector. I've always been curious how things work and as the number of programs/services grows my desire to learn how to create and manipulate them does as well. I have no formal IT experience with my knowledge coming from self-experimentation.  I hope working with [Team Name] can provide valuable insight and experience in working on an IT project. Apart from IT related projects, during my spare time I like to spend time in the backyard, where over the last few years I have been working on cultivating a garden. I like mostly to keep producing plants: lemons, apricots, mandarin oranges, kaffir, melons and tomatoes are all things I’ve managed to grow.</p>

									<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Matthew</strong> (s3858024). I was born and raised in Brisbane, Australia with a small amount living in South Australia. I'm currently engaged and hoping for our wedding in October 2020. I currently work at the Ronald McDonald House in a supportive role called "Family Experience". I have a passion for helping people and been involved with many volunteering roles throughout my life helping the community. Before my current job, I worked in a Data Centre administration role. This has given me my passion for IT and wanting to learn more about the tech world. I believe the future is IT and we must all adapt for what is coming. I'm looking forward to exploring emerging IT field ideas with my peers in our team [insert team name]. It's great we can all come together and make something great and share a common passion.</p>

									<p>Hello, I’m <strong>Mitchell</strong> (s3856807), I’m 20 years old and I was born and raised in Australia. My family consists of 2 parents and a younger brother. My background consists of Australian and British heritage as my mum was born in Australia and my Dad was born in England. My IT interest would come from my fascination for computers when I was at a young age. From that I developed a love for both computers and games, Where I would spend most of my time playing them.  I have always wanted to get into the IT industry as I have never been the most physical person and IT is just interesting and is something I would want to do for a living. In terms of hobbies, they mainly include: Gaming and Photography. In terms of IT experience unless you count fixing friends' computers or studying it during my time in school. Then I have some. If not, then I have none.</p>
